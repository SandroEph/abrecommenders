## Introduction

This is the first repository/tutorial from a series of others where I challenge myself to build, deploy and 
explain an end to end data science solution to a concrete business use case.

For this first project, the goal is to train a new recommendation system based on the MovieLens dataset, 
recommending new movies to users and then deploy this new model side to side with an existing one in order to 
A/B test those two recommendation systems to see if the new one improves the click-through rate  (users clicking on
recommendations they are presented).

## Background

This project is inspired from a question I was asked during an interview : 
> How would you compare the performance of two recommender systems in production ?

I knew the theoretical answer to this question but found that I lacked some of the 
practical skills that would allow me to solve this problem and implement its solution in production.
So here we go !

## Objectives

#### Main objective :
Design and deploy an A/B test experiment evaluating and comparing the online performance of two different recommender 
systems.
#### Secondary objectives : 
* Design and train a recommender system model
* Develop and deploy a proof of concept product website to run the experiment
* Automate the A/B testing experiment for testing purposes

## Business Case

Funflix, a movie streaming platform, wants to improve its recommendation engine. The current model used in production 
was trained on older user data and has a current click-through rate of 7% (called the baseline CTR).
The Funflix data science team wants to try developing a newer recommender system, then testing whether it will improve
click-through rate and give more relevant recommendations.

## System design

Recommendations prediction request from user traffic will be routed randomly to one of the two recommender systems
and recommendations will be shown on the website. If the user clicks on one of the recommendations, 
the click will be collected and stored to evaluate possible statistically significant change in click-through rate.

Seldon Core will be used to deploy the two recommender systems. It will make this A/B testing experiment easier as
it will provide a unified endpoint to query for recommendations, taking care of the random routing and even feedback
and evaluation loop by collecting custom metrics such as in this case the click-through rate through a 
special feedback endpoint. It also integrates well with Prometheus and Grafana and that will allow us 
to monitor the experiment's results.

One ida to improve this overall system would be to also implement periodical online re-training so that the model 
would take into consideration possible new user interactions with movies. This improvement brings alone its fair share
of new problems (eg. long and costly retraining, A/B testing statistics) so we'll leave it to maybe another project !

## Tools and packages

| Task        | Tools/Package                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
|Data & Statistics| numpy, scipy|
|Data visualisation| matplotlib|
| Model deployment and A/B testing | seldon core |
| Mock experiment website | Flask |
| Experiment simulation | selenium |
| Metrics and dashboard | Prometheus, Grafana |
| Deployment | Kubernetes, helm, Google |

## Data

The data used is the MovieLens 25M Dataset [[1]](#1). It is an industry standard recommender system benchmark. 
It contains 25M ratings of 62k different movies by 162k users. It can be downloaded 
[here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The following files are needed:

| File Name   | Description        | Columns                         |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| ratings.csv | Movies ratings     | userId,movieId,rating,timestamp |
| movies.csv  | Movies information | movieId,title,genres            |

The code in this repository assumes that the data is present in the ```/data``` folder, this can be easily modified.
