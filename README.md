## Introduction

This is the first repository/tutorial from a series of others where I challenge myself to build, deploy and 
explain an end to end data science solution to a concrete business use case.

## Background

This project is inspired from a question I was asked during an interview : 
> How would you compare the performance of two recommender systems in production ?

I had the theoretical answer to this question but found that I lacked some of the 
practical skills that would allow me to solve this problem and implement its solution in production.
